Recursion in programming is when a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. 
It is a powerful concept that can make code more elegant and efficient, but it can also lead to confusion and bugs if not used carefully. 
In my personal experience, recursion is best used in situations where a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem. 
For example, recursion is commonly used for traversing tree or graph data structures. 
When using recursion, it is important to have a clear stopping condition, or "base case", to prevent infinite loops. 
Additionally, it is important to carefully consider the computational complexity of the recursive solution, as some problems may be more efficiently solved using an iterative approach.
I believe that recursion can be a valuable tool in a programmer's toolbox, but it should be used judiciously and with a clear understanding of its potential drawbacks.
